# Web-Attacks
# Web Security Educational Demo

This project is created for educational purposes only to demonstrate common web security vulnerabilities, including SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Session Hijacking.

## Disclaimer

**Caution:** This project intentionally contains security vulnerabilities. Do not deploy this in a production environment or use real credentials. Use it solely for educational and learning purposes to understand and practice identifying and mitigating security issues.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a hands-on experience with common web security vulnerabilities:

1. **SQL Injection:**
   - Explore how improper handling of user input can lead to SQL injection attacks.
   - Learn how to protect against SQL injection by using prepared statements or parameterized queries.

2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
   - Understand how XSS vulnerabilities occur when untrusted data is rendered on web pages.
   - Practice exploiting and mitigating XSS vulnerabilities.

3. **Session Hijacking:**
   - Learn about session hijacking and the importance of securing user sessions.
   - Understand common methods used to hijack sessions and how to prevent them.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
